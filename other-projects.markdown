### The Story of Brickmaking in Pollagh, County Offaly

Local history book written with Pollagh Heritage Group, supported by Offaly County Council
This short book details the evolution of the village as shaped by its brickmaking industry which developed as a result of the development of the Grand Canal in the nineteenth century. The book gathers together interviews, written records, archival materials and photographs and provides an insights into the origins of the industry, the brickmaking process, the expansion of the canal, how the bricks were transported and sold, their uses in Offaly and in Dublin, and how the industry came to decline. It offers social, cultural and architectural insights into a unique heritage and documents the determination and hard work that was a necessary part of survival for Pollagh families in the nineteenth century and beyond.

### Places of Holes (2017)
Art project with artist Rachael Champion, supported by Creative Ireland and Offaly County Council.
Turraun Wetland, Lough Boora Discovery Park, Offaly.

Pollagh Heritage Group worked with Rachael Champion to explore the past, present and future of Irish peatlands. ‘Places of Holes’ is inspired by literal translation of Pullough as gaeilge, “Pollach”, meaning holes. Through this research and community engagement, Rachael created ‘Carbon Flux’, a site-specific installation which responds to the shifting nature of the regenerated peat bogs in the Irish Midlands. The role of Turraun wetland is paramount in the history of peat production as it was the first bog to ever produce peat for energy on an industrial scale in Ireland and subsequently one of the first industrialised bogs to come out of peat production and rewetted for conservation. Turraun is one of a number of restored peatlands in Ireland which are or have been studied by climate scientists to gain an understanding of the impact of peat production on the carbon cycle.  Sited on the threshold between industry and conservation, Carbon Flux takes inspiration from this history of industrialised peat extraction and the current role of climate science in these remarkable landscapes. Seven domed cylinders, varying in size and shades of Bord na Móna yellow, are clad in corrugated iron, a material commonly used in the everyday architecture of a working peat bog. The interior spaces of the cylinders are filled with imagery of microscopic biological life found in the bogs, bringing attention to the invaluable contribution these unseen algae play in the carbon cycle. The shape and forms of the sculptures are derived from the chamber-system method of manually collecting greenhouse gas emission data.

### Memories of Turraun (2015)
Oral history project with Pollagh Heritage Group, funded by the Heritage Council
This project sketched the cultural memory and social history of early industrial peat harvesting in Turraun, in Pollagh, County Offaly, one of the first sites of its kind in Ireland. The site is very important in Irish industrial history and the history of peat extraction in Ireland. Early industry was set up by local man, Kieran Farrelly and then taken over by Sir John Purser Griffith. Later years saw the site evolve under the management of the Turf Development Board and Bórd na Móna.  This project used oral history techniques to interview people who worked in Turraun during the height of the peat production period in the 1940s and 1950s. We created an exhibition of photographs with storytelling and the interviews are available through Tullamore library.

### Consulate of Cornerhouse: A project by Archipelago (2011)
Art project, funded by Cornerhouse Micro Commissions, supported by Paul Hamlyn Foundation.

Caitriona was part of Manchester based art collective Archipelago, which presented the project Consulate of Cornerhouse, an art event in a vacant retail unit at The Triangle Shopping centre and the Cornerhouse cafebar. Exploring the emancipatory potential of the new ‘participatory’ trend in arts organisations, the Consulate re-imagined essential elements of Cornerhouse off-site – operating as Cornerhouse ‘on foreign soil’. Allowing a look behind the scenes, visitors entered a fabrication of the Director’s office, complete with programming plans for possible future projects. Archipelago worked to realise one of these projects; that of memorialising the current Cornerhouse staff with face casts, which will then be displayed in the ‘real’ Cornerhouse. Archipelago were a group of practitioners with diverse experience across art and academia who share a common interest to artistically engage with contemporary notions of organisational structures and how this affects the various actors involved; artists, curators, institutions, and audiences.
