‘Places of Holes’ comes from the Irish name for Pollagh, 'Pollach', meaning holes. Pollagh Heritage Group worked with artist Rachael Champion to faciliate research and community engagement. Rachael created ‘Carbon Flux’, a site-specific sculptural installation in Turraun responding to the shifting nature of regenerated bogs in the Irish Midlands. Turraun was the first Irish bog to produce peat for energy on an industrial scale in Ireland and one of the first industrialised bogs to come out of production and be rewetted for conservation. Turraun, like other wetlands has been studied by climate scientists to gain an understanding of the impact of peat production on the carbon cycle.  Sited on the threshold between industry and conservation, Carbon Flux takes inspiration from this history of industrialised peat extraction and the current role of climate science in these remarkable landscapes. Seven domed cylinders, varying in size and shades of Bord na Móna yellow, are clad in corrugated iron, a material commonly used in the everyday architecture of a working peat bog. The interior spaces of the cylinders are filled with imagery of microscopic biological life found in the bogs, bringing attention to the invaluable contribution these unseen algae play in the carbon cycle. The shape and forms of the sculptures are derived from the chamber-system method of manually collecting greenhouse gas emission data. The sculptures are no longer on site. 


### Memories of Turraun

This project sketched the cultural memory and social history of early industrial peat harvesting in Turraun, in Pollagh, County Offaly, one of the first sites of its kind in Ireland. The site is very important in Irish industrial history and the history of peat extraction in Ireland. Early industry was set up by local man, Kieran Farrelly and then taken over by Sir John Purser Griffith. Later years saw the site evolve under the management of the Turf Development Board and Bórd na Móna.  This project used oral history techniques to interview people who worked in Turraun during the height of the peat production period in the 1940s and 1950s. We created an exhibition of photographs with storytelling and the interviews are available through Tullamore library.


### Consulate of Cornerhouse: a project by Archipelago 
Art project, funded by Cornerhouse Micro Commissions, supported by Paul Hamlyn Foundation (2011).

Caitriona was part of Manchester art collective Archipelago which created the project Consulate of Cornerhouse. Consulate of Cornerhouse was an art event in a vacant retail unit at The Triangle Shopping centre and the Cornerhouse cafebar. Exploring the emancipatory potential of the new ‘participatory’ trend in arts organisations, the Consulate re-imagined essential elements of Cornerhouse off-site – operating as Cornerhouse ‘on foreign soil’. Visitors entered a fabrication of the Director’s office, complete with programming plans for possible future projects. Archipelago worked to realise one of these projects; that of memorialising the current Cornerhouse staff with face casts, which were displayed in the ‘real’ Cornerhouse. Archipelago were a group of practitioners who shared a common interest to artistically engage with contemporary ideas of organisational structures and how this affects artists, curators, institutions, and audiences.
